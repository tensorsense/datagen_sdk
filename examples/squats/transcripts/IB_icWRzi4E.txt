hi I'm Roger Frampton and I'm a movement
00:00:05
coach from London and I'm author of the
00:00:07
book the flexible body so this position
00:00:10
is the squat
00:00:11
most people when I talk about the squat
00:00:13
thinking when I'm forming up and down
00:00:14
exercise it works your legs and bar
00:00:16
well the squat is actually a position
00:00:19
that we're designed to defecate in every
00:00:22
kid sits and rests in this position and
00:00:25
if we look at Western people I think
00:00:28
most people end up sitting up on their
00:00:31
toes more in this position while I'm
00:00:33
advising is that you get this position
00:00:35
back not for an exercise necessarily not
00:00:38
because of fitness or to be fitter but
00:00:40
just because you're designed to do it
00:00:43
this here is just the human resting
00:00:45
position so when I run classes people
00:00:48
always talk about the squat how they
00:00:50
can't quite get their heel down on the
00:00:51
floor now the reason for that is because
00:00:53
since about the age of four years old
00:00:55
you've been wearing shoes we are an
00:00:58
animal
we're designed to walk around on bare
00:01:00
feet and the reason that we'll lose our
00:01:02
squat mobility is simply because we come
00:01:05
to become tight in our ankles and
00:01:07
therefore you can't get all the way down
00:01:09
to the bottom now all you need to do is
00:01:11
00:01:12
if you put your heels on a yoga block or
00:01:14
a book you're in that position rather
00:01:16
than that position that will take away
00:01:19
your ankle mobility and allow you to get
00:01:21
all the way down now you can use a yoga
00:01:23
block or a book or two or three of them
00:01:24
if you're a girl squatting in heels it's
00:01:27
so much easier and squatting flat on the
00:01:29
floor so what you do is you start on
00:01:31
whatever angle you're comfortable in and
00:01:33
you work your way down to becoming flat
00:01:36
on the floor so really a squat is just a
00:01:39
test of your ankles if you've got good
00:01:42
ankles you're great at squatting and if
00:01:45
your ankles have become tight then squat
00:01:47
is really difficult and hard but like
00:01:49
every other muscle and joint in the body
00:01:51
is trainable and you've got time to get
00:01:54
it back if you do something for 10
00:01:56
minutes every day kind of like brushing
00:01:58
your teeth it gets into a habit and you
00:02:01
go you get up you brush your teeth go to
00:02:02
veggie brush your teeth so by doing 10
00:02:05
minutes every day
00:02:06
you'll get into the habit by playing
00:02:08
using just that short of a short amount
00:02:10
of time you can really focus on how your
00:02:12
body's anemic
00:02:13
now some of the exercises that I
00:02:15
recommend that you do within those 10
00:02:16
minutes first one is the squat sitting
00:02:20
in a squat not bobbing up and down just
00:02:22
being able to function to sit in the
00:02:24
squat something again is innate to us as
00:02:27
human beings and something that you are
00:02:28
able to do as a child so spend 10
00:02:31
minutes every day getting your squat
00:02:34
back
00:02:37
