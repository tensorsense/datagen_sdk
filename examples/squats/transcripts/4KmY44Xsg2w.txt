00:00:00
the basic squat so this is a fantastic
00:00:02
exercise to incorporate all the mobility
00:00:05
that you've been working on so that you
00:00:06
can demand your your ankles your knees
00:00:09
and your hips and then keeping your body
00:00:10
upright while you do the squat so
00:00:12
ideally you're getting in a position
00:00:15
where your feet I mean these no shoes
00:00:18
right now because I really like to be
00:00:19
able to feel the floor and and feel the
00:00:22
mobility and the support that I can have
00:00:24
and this is a great way to build up but
00:00:27
you can use shoes too of course and so
00:00:29
you want that tripod peeling with both
00:00:31
of your feet so you want pressure on
00:00:33
your big toe pressure on your baby toe
00:00:35
pressure on your heel and now you're
00:00:37
secure you're again your feet are
00:00:40
shoulder width apart maybe just a little
00:00:42
bit bigger and then here your knees
00:00:44
should be straight over your toes you
00:00:47
can have them out a little bit if that's
00:00:49
more comfortable for you too
00:00:50
as you're getting used to this position
00:00:52
and then from here though you want to
00:00:55
screw out your knee so you're turning
00:00:57
them out both ways right so both knees
00:01:00
are going to the outside and then as you
00:01:03
go down you're dropping your your pelvis
00:01:06
and you're continuing to push your knees
00:01:08
out as you go down so you want to be
00:01:11
able to go all the way down making sure
00:01:14
that you have good even pressure and
00:01:16
you're keeping your body up the whole
00:01:18
time and then you return to neutral so
00:01:20
as you learn to squat you want to be
00:01:23
able to use all the angles and the range
00:01:26
of motions of all these joints to be
00:01:28
able to get you down and up and then the
00:01:30
strengthen of all those muscles to pull
00:01:32
it together so that it's nice and easy
00:01:34
so below parallel is something you also
00:01:37
want to aim for you can always hold on
00:01:38
00:01:39
to a chair if you need but you're aiming
00:01:41
to get those knees out and then you're
00:01:43
dropping your pelvis below the knee
00:01:46
level so this is about parallel here
00:01:48
this is below parallel here and that's
00:01:50
what you're aiming for so if you're
00:01:52
starting out and you don't have any
00:01:54
mobility maybe this is what you're doing
00:01:56
that's fine keep working on that because
00:01:58
add as you continue to develop that and
00:02:00
do some other work for mobility on your
00:02:04
your joints you're gonna start to see
00:02:06
that you'll have better
00:02:07
ability so you're gonna do a set of ten
00:02:09
and you're going to aim to get all the
00:02:11
way down all the way down below parallel
00:02:14
and that guy so you want to do three
00:02:18
sets of ten and hit that gets easy of
00:02:20
course it will you certainly can add
00:02:22
some weight so kettlebell is a great
00:02:25
thing to add in I like to hold it upside
00:02:27
down it's very easy this way
00:02:29
and from here you're going down and at
00:02:33
the same position so you're really
00:02:35
pushing those knees out you're getting
00:02:37
good support with your feet you're
00:02:39
strengthening those feet because we've
00:02:40
been doing some feet exercises as well
00:02:42
and all the way down and back up and
00:02:44
then again you're just doing three sets
00:02:46
of ten and the and the heavier you go
00:02:49
the harder it is happen
