00:00:00
squats are the king of poorly performed
00:00:03
exercises do them wrong and instead of
00:00:05
growing nice quads and glutes you'll
00:00:07
feel aches and pains in your knees your
00:00:09
hips and even your shoulders but follow
00:00:11
these four easy steps and I guarantee
00:00:13
your squats will feel better and grow
00:00:15
your muscles far better than they ever
00:00:17
have before
00:00:18
step one setup your Anatomy will
00:00:21
determine what your perfect squat looks
00:00:23
like so it's important to find the right
00:00:24
setup for you and your body before you
00:00:27
even get under the bar let's start with
00:00:29
your footsteps hold the light weight at
00:00:32
your chest set your feet hip width apart
00:00:34
and squat down see how that feels and
00:00:37
make note of how low you should get then
00:00:40
widen it by an inch or two and compare
00:00:42
even the slightest modification can make
00:00:44
a world of difference for knee and hip
00:00:46
pain so keep going until you find what
00:00:48
feels best and enables you to squat the
00:00:50
lowest as for your foot angle most
00:00:52
people's joints will feel better with
00:00:54
their toes pointed out slightly so don't
00:00:57
force yourself to keep them straight and
00:00:59
The Wider The Stance you use the more
00:01:01
your toes will have to turn out once
00:01:04
you've found the right stance hello
00:01:05
there it's time to grab the bar
00:01:08
set your feet under the bar bend your
00:01:11
knees to get under it and then place the
00:01:13
bar on your upper back but avoid placing
00:01:16
it too high on the little bony bump at
00:01:18
the base of your neck it should be
00:01:20
placed right onto the meat of your traps
00:01:22
next grip the bar with your hands as
00:01:25
narrow as you can without feeling pain
00:01:27
in your wrists shoulders or elbows the
00:01:30
narrower they are the more upper back
00:01:32
tightness and stability you'll have when
00:01:34
you squat but if you have really tight
00:01:37
shoulders or chest muscles you may have
00:01:39
to widen this once you grab the bar Walk
00:01:42
It Out by extending your legs to lift it
00:01:44
out of the rack and then taking three
00:01:46
careful steps
00:01:48
take a little step back with one foot a
00:01:51
little step back with your second foot
00:01:52
and then use the third step to widen or
00:01:55
adjust your feet to your ideal squat
00:01:58
stance lastly to keep you balanced as
00:02:01
you squat spread your weight evenly over
00:02:03
your foot by making sure each foot has
00:02:06
three solid points of contact with the
00:02:08
ground your big toe your pinky toe and
00:02:11
your heel you're now ready for step two
00:02:13
creating whole body tension now at this
00:02:16
point you do not want to just squat down
00:02:18
you need to First activate several key
00:02:21
muscles that will protect your back and
00:02:23
keep you strong as you squat down
00:02:25
failure to do this is why so many people
00:02:27
have a really strong leg press but I
00:02:29
have a much weaker and unstable squat
00:02:32
what start with the lower body screw
00:02:36
your feet into the ground as if you were
00:02:38
trying to touch your heels together then
00:02:40
level your pelvis with the floor by
00:02:42
tilting it back as if it was a bowl of
00:02:44
water and you were trying to prevent it
00:02:46
from spilling once adjusted lock this in
00:02:49
by squeezing your inner thighs glutes
00:02:52
and quads for the upper body avoid
00:02:55
pointing your elbows back and losing
00:02:56
00:02:57
tightness in your upper back
00:02:58
instead pull your elbows forward under
00:03:01
the bar and pull the bar down into your
00:03:04
media upper traps as if you're trying to
00:03:06
bend the bar in half this helps activate
00:03:08
your lats and keeps your upper back
00:03:10
stable
00:03:11
00:03:12
finally take a deep 360 breath into your
00:03:15
waist as if you're trying to expand all
00:03:18
sides of a weight belt and then brace
00:03:20
your core as if you just coughed really
00:03:22
hard at this point you should feel your
00:03:25
legs core and lats all working you're
00:03:28
ready for step three The Descent
00:03:31
pull yourself down into the squat using
00:03:33
your hamstrings let your butt drop down
00:03:36
between your heels and push your knees
00:03:38
out in the same direction as your toes
00:03:42
keep your upper back tight by pulling
00:03:44
the bar down and continue lowering as
00:03:46
deep as you comfortably can as for how
00:03:49
deep you should go a 2019 study assigned
00:03:52
one group of subjects to half squats and
00:03:54
another group to deep squats twice a
00:03:57
week for 10 weeks although both groups
00:03:59
had similar growth in the quads the
00:04:02
glutes and abductors grew significantly
00:04:04
more in the Deep squat group so your
00:04:07
goal should be to squat down to at least
00:04:09
somewhere close to parallel if you use a
00:04:12
narrower stance you should be able to
00:04:13
get a little bit deeper if you use a
00:04:15
wider stance it'll be closer to parallel
00:04:17
but if towards the bottom of your squat
00:04:20
your upper body falls forward or your
00:04:23
heels come off the ground or your lower
00:04:26
back rounds excessively into Butt Wink
00:04:28
these are all signs that you're not yet
00:04:31
ready to go that deep and there's two
00:04:33
main reasons for this the most common
00:04:35
reason is the limited ankle mobility in
00:04:38
this case try elevating your heels onto
00:04:40
weight plates and see if that helps the
00:04:43
other reason is a weak core and glutes
00:04:46
in this case you can try out a more
00:04:48
stable exercise like Smith machine
00:04:50
squats before progressing to the barbell
00:04:52
but once you can get deep enough you may
00:04:55
notice that your knees end up over your
00:04:56
00:04:57
toes this is commonly believed to be
00:04:59
harmful on the knees
00:05:01
one study tested this by using a wooden
00:05:04
barrier to prevent the knees from going
00:05:05
over the toes while there was a bit less
00:05:08
pressure on the knees when compared to
00:05:10
letting them travel over the toes the
00:05:13
stress on the hips and lower back
00:05:14
significantly increased so as long as
00:05:17
your knees don't cave in or out and
00:05:20
instead push out in the same direction
00:05:22
as your toes letting your knees go over
00:05:24
your toes is perfectly fine now once you
00:05:27
reach that bottom position do not just
00:05:29
let gravity drop you into that last
00:05:31
introduce research suggests this is the
00:05:34
most important part of the movement for
00:05:36
growth so force your muscles to work by
00:05:38
controlling the weight down and pausing
00:05:40
at that bottom position for half a
00:05:42
second before moving on to step four the
00:05:45
ascent but first just keep in mind that
00:05:47
everyone's bodies are different to
00:05:49
maximize growth and prevent injury it's
00:05:51
important that you find the right
00:05:52
exercises and the right form for your
00:05:54
individual structure and for
00:05:56
step-by-step plan that takes care of all
00:05:58
the guesswork for you after this video

00:06:03
analysis quiz to find the best program
00:06:05
for you and your body but for now let's
00:06:08
move on to step four the ascent
00:06:10
the most common mistake people make here
00:06:13
is shooting their hips back and letting
00:06:15
their upper body fall forward this puts
00:06:17
00:06:18
a lot of pressure on the lower back we
00:06:20
want the chest and hips to rise at the
00:06:22
same rate to do this drive up out of the
00:06:25
Bottom by pushing the floor away and
00:06:28
thinking about driving your traps up
00:06:30
against the bar keep your glutes engaged
00:06:32
by keeping your knees in line with your
00:06:34
toes rather than keeping them in
00:06:36
continue pushing down against the floor
00:06:39
and getting tall until your legs are
00:06:41
fully extended but as you come to the
00:06:44
top avoid letting out a big exhale
00:06:46
instead we want to maximize the pressure
00:06:49
in your abdomen to protect your back and
00:06:52
you can do this by keeping your lips
00:06:53
00:06:54
held tighter together as you breathe out
00:06:56
to gradually let air out once you've let
00:06:59
all the air out take another deep 360
00:07:01
breath in brace and repeat for another
00:07:04
rep congrats my friend you have just
00:07:07
done the perfect squat you can give this
00:07:10
video a watch next to learn how to
00:07:11
properly deadlift without hurting your
00:07:13
back and I'll see you next time
