hi guys this is dr raz the physical
00:00:06
therapist with the center for total back
00:00:08
care
i'm going to talk to you today about
00:00:10
exercises for prevention of knee pain
00:00:13
one of those exercises is squats when
00:00:15
you're doing squats you want to make
00:00:17
sure you have proper form
00:00:18
so what i usually tell patients is you
00:00:20
want to pretend like you're sitting in a
00:00:22
chair
00:00:23
you never want your knees to go over
00:00:25
your toes
00:00:26
and you should be able to wiggle your
00:00:27
toes as you come down
00:00:29
and back up so again should be able to
00:00:31
wiggle your toes pretend like you're
00:00:33
sitting back in a chair
00:00:34
keep your head and chest up and then
00:00:36
back up
00:00:38
a lot of people tend to do an improper
00:00:40
squat they tend to put a lot of
00:00:42
their weight through their toes and it
00:00:44
looks like this
00:00:46
as you can see my knees are going over
00:00:48
my toes and that puts a lot of stress
00:00:51
on the knee joint so you want to avoid
00:00:53
that and make sure you're sitting back
00:00:55
chest up head up and wiggle your toes
