00:00:00
I build my body for me and it's always
00:00:05
been about improving my health and to
00:00:08
improve my quality of life I was
00:00:14
overweight I was asthmatic and I really
00:00:16
struggled fitting in at school Fitness
00:00:20
became something for me that allowed me
00:00:23
to break through that barrier and become
00:00:25
more confident
00:00:29
a body boarder to me is somebody who
00:00:31
builds their bodies to not only improve
00:00:34
their physical appearance to build more
00:00:37
muscle but it's definitely to improve
00:00:39
the quality of their life and what comes
00:00:43
with that is confidence
00:00:45
[Music]
00:00:48
and so further my body has become more
00:00:50
than just about how I look in the mirror
00:00:52
to become far more over the years of
00:00:55
looking inwards and understanding how
00:00:58
it's benefiting my life that it's become
00:01:01
something that I can continue for years
00:01:04
to come
00:01:07
[Music]
00:01:10
it always comes back to am I happy with
00:01:13
what I've achieved within myself the
00:01:16
effort I've put in and if I can say yes
00:01:19
then I have won regardless of what I've
00:01:23
done the fitness lifestyle the
00:01:29
bodybuilding lifestyle whatever you want
00:01:31
to call it to me it's become easier
00:01:33
because it's not a choice not something
00:01:36
I have to do it's not something I wake
00:01:38
up and I think about doing it just
00:01:40
happens because of the years of
00:01:42
repetition of waking up and doing the
00:01:45
things that make me feel good and it's
00:01:48
totally worth it like it's not even a
00:01:50
question because the reward is there
00:01:53

00:03:33

00:03:56
and we'll do our best answer them the
00:03:58
best we can so yeah please ask us
00:04:06
questions about but I'm sweating about
00:04:08
fitness in general nutrition and
00:04:10
bodybuilding anything you have a
00:04:12
question about we're gonna do our best
00:04:13
age them for you and let's get started I
00:04:17
have a sound does it sound working can
00:04:21
everyone hear me tips for keeping weight
00:04:24
00:04:25
loss weight up heels
00:04:26
Syrena okay we're gonna get there hang
00:04:28
on we're going to go through lots of
00:04:30
stuff about the squat we're going to get
00:04:32
to your questions in one second or
00:04:34
coming more than one second multiple
00:04:36
seconds but we're gonna get there okay
00:04:38
Dean are you ready yep okay Honda so
00:04:42
deeply to do most of his success facing
00:04:44
this way so you guys can see when his
00:04:46
body is doing and
00:04:48
we're the ghosts not touch him as we go
00:04:51
along should be good
00:04:54
first things first when it comes to
00:04:56
squat for most beginners and I
00:04:59
particularly see this issue in women is
00:05:01
when people squat the first word which
00:05:03
she squats the first thing she does is
00:05:05
she brings her knees forward look at
00:05:08
that does that look familiar
00:05:09
so what happens when you try to squat
00:05:11
with your knees forward that puts a lot
00:05:14
of tension here but you can't use your
00:05:17
not using your huge boobs your butt at
00:05:19
all really you can sit back up it's all
00:05:21
quads in the bodybuilding world and some
00:05:23
of this you can call this a squat
00:05:27
aptly named I don't suggest using that
00:05:31
if you're learning how to do a proper
00:05:32
back squat or really any other squat
00:05:34
00:05:35
variation the the best way to do to
00:05:40
learn how to do the squat movement at
00:05:42
all is called a hip hinge and this means
00:05:44
you push your hips and butt backwards
00:05:46
like these doing so see how his first
00:05:51
movement is back not forward if you have
00:05:57
your hips back you can do it's much much
00:06:00
easier to keep your weight in your heels
00:06:02
it's much much easier to have your
00:06:03
weight evenly distributed it's much less
00:06:06
likely that you're gonna come up on your
00:06:07
toes much better overall
00:06:11
[Music]
00:06:14
Wow Harley Reid asks what's the best to
00:06:18
do squats what Smith Machine barbell or
00:06:20
dumbbell Harley that's a great question
00:06:23
the answer is it depends like usual I
00:06:29
don't like the smith machine because
00:06:31
that makes you sit in a very awkward
00:06:33
position because that barbell is on in a
00:06:36
fixed plane I would much prefer that you
00:06:39
do a just straight full out regular
00:06:42
barbell and we'll talk about the reasons
00:06:44
why because you can play where the
00:06:47
barbell sits on your back a little bit
00:06:48
that Barbeau and move better over your
00:06:50
center of mass which on the Smith
00:06:52
machine does it do very well and
00:06:55
dumbbell you can definitely use a
00:06:56
dumbbell if you want or dumbbells if you
00:06:58
want to totally depends on your goals I
00:07:00
mean as far as like leg growth I would
00:07:06
say use a regular barbell for me to well
00:07:16
as well how many days a week should you
00:07:18
squat if I were Cory Gregory I would
00:07:21
tell you to squat everyday all of this
00:07:23
box every day honestly that depends
00:07:25
intern
00:07:26
I'm so sorry most of my answers sir
00:07:28
everyone is going to be it depends
00:07:29
depends on your goal I mean you can
00:07:34
technically SWAT every day if you want
00:07:36
to your fury few if your legs are a
00:07:38
little bitty leg then you want to put
00:07:40
some meat on them eat a lot of food and
00:07:41
do a lot of spots if you're working for
00:07:45
like if you want to get on a power
00:07:47
lifting platform and you want to squat
00:07:49
with that I would I would program your
00:07:50
spots differently probably don't need
00:07:53
that much volume you want to work for
00:07:56
weight not volume even that's its name
00:08:02
sometimes for a beginner if you're a
00:08:06
beginner and I would say twice a week to
00:08:08
start if you really like and then you
00:08:10
can go up to three times a week if you
00:08:11
like there's really no like right or
00:08:13
wrong to that it completely depends on
00:08:15
what you want to do for your legs and
00:08:19
why you do squats in the first place
00:08:22
Serena Shaw asks deeper squats are good
00:08:24
comment yes answer is it depends on your
00:08:28
ability
00:08:30
you're built on your goal deeper squats
00:08:34
I mean if you're gonna be an Olympic
00:08:36
lifter crossfitter yes you're gonna have
00:08:38
to learn how to squat go deeper if
00:08:40
you're gonna be a power lifter really
00:08:42
your hips just have to go barely under
00:08:44
below your median we'll talk about that
00:08:46
as we ain't going for it Wow what should
00:08:52
people do if they have bad knees that's
00:08:54
it that's a really good question so
00:08:55
there's this like crazy even fade the
00:08:57
cameras here there's a lot of really
00:09:00
weird information out there about how
00:09:03
squatting is bad for your knees and
00:09:05
that's just truly not the case it isn't
00:09:08
the case if you do a really poor squat
00:09:10
like Dee was just showing us if you're
00:09:12
coming forward that puts a lot of
00:09:14
sharing your knees that's gonna hurt
00:09:15
like hell if you're going to come back
00:09:16
and use your your hamstrings and your
00:09:18
butt to do the work that's going to put
00:09:20
a lot less tension or just on your knees
00:09:22
and if we're the more the lower you go
00:09:24
really in the squat the less attention
00:09:26
there is underneath because you're your
00:09:29
posterior chain is going to do the work
00:09:31
so it's not going to be bad for you
00:09:34
knees if you want a little extra cushion
00:09:37
and help grab some nice leaps five or
00:09:41
seven millimeters thick
00:09:42
the thicker they are the
00:09:44
more you're gonna be down at the bottom
00:09:47
these might help you or get some wraps
00:09:50
try those out but just because you have
00:09:53
bad knees and it really I would talk to
00:09:54
00:09:55
a doctor if they're really bad that
00:09:57
they're broken or some issue don't do
00:09:59
squats but it's there just source or if
00:10:02
you have some tendinitis like that's so
00:10:04
it's kind of stuff you might just have
00:10:05
to work um Julie OS what if people still
00:10:10
had a backache
00:10:11
if your spots are hurt in your back
00:10:13
you're doing they've been properly and
00:10:15
we're going to talk about that one
00:10:16
when we get to that so yes Jake when I
00:10:21
find when I do squats I feel that most
00:10:23
of my quads and hams how do I tack the
00:10:25
Blues better and talk about that I would
00:10:27
change the position on your back of the
00:10:28
bar on the back put a little lower sit
00:10:30
back a little further we're gonna get
00:10:31
there Jake good question okay yes
00:10:47
I don't know I know I don't think so I -
00:10:55
yeah I think you you need to lock them
00:10:57
out that frog Alice you I mean if your
00:10:59
hips are again depends on the sport like
00:11:02
I don't think that powerlifting that has
00:11:03
to be left out I think in general if
00:11:05
your hips are squared and straight then
00:11:09
you're good to go
00:11:10
yeah I don't I don't see why you would
00:11:12
need to lock them out in general like in
00:11:15
life Anthony for beginners is good
00:11:23
questions suggests high bar a low blow
00:11:25
bar spot for beginners I suggest low bar
00:11:27
for beginners and they'll tell you why
00:11:29
when we get there usually somebody gave
00:11:30
questions I can't even start my tutorial
00:11:33
how do we gauge my triceps Norman
00:11:36
sweating that's probably a troll
00:11:37
question good one I like it okay so I'm
00:11:43
gonna I'm gonna start talking things I'm
00:11:45
gonna like come back every couple
00:11:46
minutes stick to you guys I love all
00:11:48
your questions keep them coming and get
00:11:49
to them as best as I can okay um one
00:11:54
thing you can do here if you're just
00:11:57
starting out and you need help
00:12:04
figuring how to splice to pull the bench
00:12:06
up and I see you and then just watch to
00:12:09
the bench
00:12:12
good and then you stand back up so I
00:12:14
challenge some of you if you actually
00:12:16
sit for a little bit
00:12:17
good this is going to help you teach how
00:12:20
to push your butt back yeah
00:12:23
junky yeah this section really scary to
00:12:27
people that aren't used to using a using
00:12:31
their hips and their right intentions to
00:12:33
do a squat pushing your hips back is
00:12:35
going to help engage your glutes your
00:12:37
hamstrings if you do it this way and why
00:12:40
your since helps so this is what I
00:12:44
suggest instead of having the Box kind
00:12:45
of right up on your under your butt so
00:12:47
you just sort of mid I would push it
00:12:48
back a little bit to reach more this is
00:12:51
high lower good so if you see here
00:13:06
Dean's keeping a pretty good straight of
00:13:09
her back he's reaching back with his
00:13:12
hips he's keeping his weight I'm looking
00:13:14
I can see that he me his weight on his
00:13:16
heels he could pull his toes off the
00:13:19
ground if he wants
00:13:20
you don't necessarily have to do that
00:13:22
except I don't suggest another kind of
00:13:26
interesting tip with you stand up if
00:13:28
you're standing in your toes if you
00:13:30
actually squeeze your front toe that
00:13:33
turns your butt on weirdly enough so I
00:13:36
like to when I'm squatting get my
00:13:39
position squeeze my big toe in and then
00:13:42
I go so my butt's turned on I don't have
00:13:44
to think about it it just does it okay
00:13:47
another really great tool you can use to
00:13:49
help you squat a little better it's to
00:13:51
learn what to do with your knees and
00:13:55
hips if you use a slingshot hip circle
00:13:59
hashtag mark bell rules put this on this
00:14:04
can go right above your knees it's a
00:14:06
trick to using a hip circle is to keep
00:14:09
tension on the bands and that's gonna
00:14:12
help you come back down so a lot of
00:14:18
other issues I see again particularly
00:14:20
with women it just--there's when they
00:14:22
spot their knees cave in I'm sure a lot
00:14:24
of you guys see that and the amount of
00:14:26
ACL tears and the amount of issues with
00:14:28
knees and hips and lower back that women
00:14:31
have I think they'll have a lot to do
00:14:32
with this sort of I don't know for some
00:14:35
reason girls get taught to squat like
00:14:37
this
00:14:38
there's like a lot of other things that
00:14:40
I talk about a Q angle or just it's
00:14:42
generally hamstrung weakness and women
00:14:45
00:14:46
because we do a lot of stuff in their
quads so using a hip circle will help
00:14:50
you keep your knees out because you're
00:14:51
keeping tension on the bands and as you
00:14:53
come down and up we have to keep tension
00:14:56
on the band so i really suggest grabbing
00:14:58
one of these or just really any sort of
00:15:01
band in general that you can put over
00:15:04
your knees above your knees and then
00:15:06
keep tension on as you're doing your
00:15:08
squats this the slingshot is available
00:15:10
in the BB come store if you're
00:15:12
interested okay have an answer some
00:15:16
questions okay Mikey you're doing great
00:15:24
with the troll questions broke my feet
00:15:27
so Bernard asks I cannot keep steady on
00:15:30
the floor when I squat how do I address
00:15:32
it I think not to keep steady does that
00:15:34
mean that comes up and down if you are
00:15:39
coming up on your toes as you're coming
00:15:41
back it generally means that you I mean
00:15:44
I take away completely off the bar and I
00:15:46
would start from scratch that's
00:15:48
generally the advice they give to most
00:15:49
dudes that come into the gym you've all
00:15:52
seen him he comes in he puts 315 on the
00:15:54
bar and he does this
00:15:58
it's my squat
00:16:00
take them take the weight up put 135 on
00:16:02
it's not like who is a grub just do them
00:16:05
that work properly learn how to put your
00:16:07
feet learn how to use your butt and your
00:16:10
hands chance to do this why you're gonna
00:16:11
have much better I mean it's gonna take
00:16:12
more time if you do they're in the
00:16:13
movement properly moving well means that
00:16:16
you will eventually do more weight so I
00:16:19
would address it by honestly starting
00:16:22
over see what happens
00:16:23
I haven't seen you do your squat it's
00:16:25
hard for me to stay like one so what
00:16:26
your feet are to know where your feet
00:16:27
are actually doing start from scratch
00:16:30
gendering that helps
00:16:31
it's like restarting your computer just
00:16:34
turn it off and then turn it back up
00:16:36
okay how do I maintain yoke like
00:16:40
shoulders don't squat
00:16:44
shoulders
00:16:47
how do i presenters well ravi asks how
00:16:51
to prevent from falling off with
00:16:53
squatting asta grass so falling forward
00:16:56
i imagine if you're falling just don't
00:17:00
smile ass to grass there's no rules
00:17:01
anywhere that says you have to squat ass
00:17:04
to crest let's talk about proper depth
00:17:08
stuff your power lifter your depth is
00:17:13
once your increase gets below your knees
00:17:16
that it's to depth now a lot of the goal
00:17:21
really good power lifters is to flirt
00:17:23
with that line which is why you have
00:17:24
judges and which is why some power
00:17:26
lifters don't get a lift because really
00:17:28
the goal is the shortest amount of range
00:17:31
of motion if that makes sense
00:17:33
so you're trying to get as much weight
00:17:35
as you can and move that weight really
00:17:36
and this little shortest line is
00:17:38
00:17:39
possible if you are trying to be a
00:17:42
weight lifter dude you go there before
00:17:45
so a lot of times I hear weight lifting
00:17:47
if you need to clean or snatch you're
00:17:49
going to be in this position
00:17:50
waiting the front of your weight over
00:17:52
your head so if your if your
00:17:55
weightlifting really here into CrossFit
00:17:57
you're gonna have to come down a little
00:17:59
bit further but there's no right or
00:18:01
wrong answer and more importantly not a
00:18:04
lot not all of us are built to squat a
00:18:08
stress a lot of us have hip issues our
00:18:12
femurs might be too long or too short
00:18:13
we'll have knees that are built
00:18:15
differently ankle mobility might be an
00:18:17
issue for that so really your goal is to
00:18:21
squat as deep as you can that's
00:18:23
comfortable and safe for your ability
00:18:25
and your body body type that's what it
00:18:28
that's that's the ultimate goal today
00:18:30
and we'll talk about the button q2 a lot
00:18:32
of people and a lot of people do that
00:18:42
and that causes so if you're having
00:18:43
lower need to sit back up if you're
00:18:45
having lower back pain as you're
00:18:48
squatting that's probably the issue and
00:18:50
there's a lot of things that could be
00:18:51
going on I mean the over simplified
00:18:54
answer is that your ham shoes are tight
00:18:56
you can work in your mobility I I mean I
00:18:58
am a total believer in the ability
00:19:00
that's going to help you do you move
00:19:01
well it's going to help you add weight
00:19:05
but that's that's really a pretty
00:19:07
oversimplified answers lots of us have
00:19:09
our hip sockets or femur hook spin is
00:19:14
can be deep it can be shallow the bone
00:19:17
itself can be longer or shorter there's
00:19:19
a lot of things that can that can make
00:19:21
our our body's ability to move difficult
00:19:26
so I would just say if you can this is
00:19:30
what I would say film yourself doing a
00:19:32
squat from the side if you notice your
00:19:34
butt tucking under then play with that
00:19:37
depth come down only as far until your
00:19:40
butt starts it's a tuck and then just
00:19:42
come back up and work on your mobility
00:19:44
work on getting to a safe spot until you
00:19:49
can check yep until you can get deeper
00:19:54
and deeper and deeper in your squat as
00:19:56
you go really unless
00:19:58
like trying to be a pro weightlifter
00:20:02
there's no reason to do and ask graphs
00:20:05
why you can argue that there's more quad
00:20:08
or hip muscle whatever the word is
00:20:13
happening question Christopher twitch
00:20:24
what's his name again
00:20:26
frog - shotgun gypsy asks when he's
00:20:28
coming up for me to squat Hannah says
00:20:30
that one leg is more dominant than the
00:20:32
other there's an exercise to
00:20:34
strengthening that or to help that
00:20:36
imbalance that's actually super duper
00:20:38
common all of us have a dominant leg I
00:20:41
don't say do your unilateral training do
00:20:45
your Bulgarian split squat to do your
00:20:47
step ups do your lunges but don't do
00:20:50
your way to less weight on each side do
00:20:54
the same way on each side they're gonna
00:20:55
catch back up but yeah I really think
00:20:57
that unilateral training will help you
00:20:58
balance that up and keep doing your
00:21:01
squats again like your body will catch
00:21:03
up to itself it's just going to take a
00:21:06
lot of time
00:21:07
so good question okay I'm gonna see what
00:21:11
questions we have here
00:21:13
Larissa asks what to do for pain on the
00:21:17
hip flexors when squatting that's also
00:21:20
really common and again that's
00:21:22
a lot to do with how your villa that's a
00:21:24
lot to do with your mobility work on
00:21:27
your mobility make sure you're doing
00:21:28
your warm up properly if it's severe
00:21:31
pain that like you can't work through
00:21:33
just don't do them I mean the gym is
00:21:37
full of really cool equipment that
00:21:38
doesn't hurt you and again if your goal
00:21:40
is lifelong health or wellness
00:21:42
moving well don't do things that hurt
00:21:44
you if your goal is to be a pro water
00:21:47
then you're gonna have to deal with a
00:21:49
little bit of clean in order to get paid
00:21:51
to get to that level so again I would I
00:21:54
would work in every building that
00:21:55
doesn't seem to be helping go to an RT
00:21:58
or go to a chiropractor or go to a PT
00:22:01
and see if they can help you get there
00:22:04
otherwise it's just a little bit of
00:22:06
discomfort I would say it will probably
00:22:07
work itself out in a couple cents
00:22:17
you do question good question Joshua
00:22:23
asks what are the best shoes for squats
00:22:25
answer it depends weird not deep so a
00:22:30
lot of people really like these
00:22:31
weightlifting shoes now because they
00:22:33
have a lot of heel so if you find
00:22:35
yourself well here's the issue number
00:22:38
billion a lot of people have poor ankle
00:22:42
mobility which means that getting into
00:22:44
this position at all it's really hard on
00:22:47
their ankles so if you can get your feet
00:22:49
up your heels up a little bit that helps
00:22:52
it improves economically that helps
00:22:54
improve that position if you don't have
00:22:56
these shoes
00:22:57
nanos actually like Dean's what these
00:23:00
wearing have a little bit of heel on
00:23:01
00:23:02
them these are good
00:23:03
I would totally refrain from wearing
00:23:05
anything that has anything squishy in it
00:23:07
when you're squatting that's just bad
00:23:09
that's just like makes everything really
00:23:10
unstable and you can collapse in and out
00:23:13
and if you're having issues with your
00:23:14
feet is running that's another thing it
00:23:15
might be your shoes take them off just
00:23:18
wringer their feet where your chucks if
00:23:20
you need a little help if you're doing
00:23:22
squats I wouldn't do this on heavy
00:23:23
squats but if you're sort of like doing
00:23:25
lighter spots put a little pin on plate
00:23:28
under your heels and that can help you
00:23:35
yeah you are out from twitch socks or
00:23:38
bare feet also weren't just fine that
00:23:41
tends to work better you see a lot of
00:23:43
people doing the low bar squat and bare
00:23:46
feet are very like have nothing in their
00:23:49
shoes but jaylen let's talk about the
00:23:51
difference between a high bar and a
00:23:52
little bar spot while we're here you
00:23:56
guys asked somebody big questions sorry
00:23:58
I can't get to the wrong okay so he
00:24:00
needed to do a high bar spot first so
00:24:02
that is the the bar center lane right on
00:24:05
the top of his tracks
00:24:06
and that's going to mean that he's going
00:24:08
00:24:09
to be able to stay in his upper body to
00:24:10
be able to stay really upright as he
00:24:12
squats down and I'll sweep in the also
00:24:18
means I'm just identifying for
00:24:19
elimination
00:24:20
that also means that his ankle here and
00:24:23
here are much more severe in here than
00:24:26
it would be in above our spot so this is
00:24:29
squatting like this takes
00:24:30
in time to figure out how to do that's
00:24:33
why I don't suggest it for just a more
00:24:40
difficult to that stay down here it's
00:24:42
just a more difficult position as you
00:24:44
get into mobility lice but if you're
00:24:48
working on more athletic movements like
00:24:50
the snatch or clean and jerk I totally
00:24:52
suggest using the high bar squat if you
00:24:56
are a mobile person and it's grinding is
00:25:00
sort of pain free for you then why not
00:25:02
use that it's going to be a little bit
00:25:04
more clot dominant than a low bar spot
00:25:06
but I mean you're so definitely gonna
00:25:08
turn on your hamstrings and your in your
00:25:10
glutes
00:25:11
it's not gonna not use them and then a
00:25:14
low bar spot the bars actually going to
00:25:16
land a little shelf right here under so
00:25:21
you have like your traps you mean your
00:25:23
tractor a lot of muscle there's a little
00:25:26
area right here underneath and that you
00:25:27
can shove that bar underneath your head
00:25:29
is going to be more neutral and a low
00:25:31
bar spot and then like an organ always
00:25:34
with the earlier
00:25:36
are going to really far back in a little
00:25:38
bar slot nice Dean that's perfect and if
00:25:40
you'll notice he doesn't have to go as
00:25:43
deep in this one and these angles are
00:25:45
much less acute his shins are a little
00:25:48
bit they're much more vertical as we say
00:25:51
and then his upper body if the little
00:25:54
more leaves forward to me although you
00:25:57
can go ahead the balance portion is a
00:26:00
little bit more different you're not
00:26:01
used to pushing your hips back the
00:26:03
balance is a little bit more difficult
00:26:05
but in terms of how your body the amount
00:26:09
of the amount of like muscle fibers
00:26:11
whatever your body uses increases in the
00:26:14
squat and it's general knowledge that in
00:26:17
a low bar back so I can probably squeak
00:26:19
out an extra 5% as opposed to I had my
00:26:22
best foot that's why but I think that
00:26:23
entirely depends on who's doing the
00:26:27
squatting and how good they are at
00:26:30
sweating so as a beginner play with that
00:26:32
00:26:33
low bar back squat
00:26:34
yes you're going to be a little bit more
00:26:36
forward and you're gonna have to be
00:26:37
really good or you're just is to move
00:26:39
from squat say shut up I'm doing a low
00:26:41
bar my hips are back I'm doing what
00:26:43
I know I should be doing question
00:26:51
configuration hurts fighting Joshua from
00:26:55
twitch from the youtubes um yeah that's
00:26:59
strange that they're doing that I'm not
00:27:00
sure if you're squatting and as you're
00:27:02
squatting they do this um that's strange
00:27:06
and yes that would make squatting more
00:27:09
difficult cuz that would make it more
00:27:10
likely that your knees would come into
00:27:12
so that's really hard on your body they
00:27:14
have your feet coming and your knees go
00:27:15
out I don't even know that's rough so I
00:27:18
would really work on and if you need to
00:27:22
make this more severe than you would
00:27:24
normally you can go ahead and do that if
00:27:26
it's easier for you or more helpful to
00:27:28
heavier your total shoved out really
00:27:30
really wide in order to make it so they
00:27:32
don't come in do that but yeah I would
00:27:35
the pronation is not helping you at all
00:27:37
okay go back to the youtubes or I'm
00:27:41
sorry to the Facebook's Alex asks you
00:27:45
mentioned ACLs what do you recommend for
00:27:47
squats when someone has had ACL
00:27:49
reconstruction on their knees and it's
00:27:51
starting to squat all over again
00:27:52
I recommend
00:27:54
I recommend doing this light squats to a
00:28:05
ball until she gets her strength or her
00:28:09
he or she gets their strength back back
00:28:11
the again with the squat the most
00:28:14
important thing about a squat even said
00:28:16
I want to do is the movement pattern
00:28:19
itself move well before you throw away
00:28:22
on the park unless you're a crazy person
00:28:26
is just ultra strong um if you're if
00:28:32
someone has had an ACL injuries there's
00:28:35
a lot that could be happening but moving
00:28:36
on living properly understanding what
00:28:39
the knee should be doing which is
00:28:41
definitely not caving in which might
00:28:43
have been part of the issue in the first
00:28:44
place that they're out not necessarily
00:28:47
so and then there's a lot of weird stuff
00:28:49
about how your knees have to be like way
00:28:51
out when you squat that's not necessary
00:28:54
it's definitely true and your knees can
00:28:56
come in a little bit as long as they're
00:28:57
aligned with your toes that's pretty
00:28:59
good advice and you'll notice if you
00:29:02
have and you can watch even really
00:29:04
really good squatters come down all the
00:29:07
way
come in a little bit but they shove them
00:29:09
on the way out so that's going to happen
00:29:12
as long as you're aware of what where
00:29:15
your feet are or your knees are where
00:29:17
your hips are our shoulders are at all
00:29:19
times during the squat that's the
00:29:21
important part
00:29:22
the important part is moving what's up
00:29:25
ATL light spot grab a kettlebell grab
00:29:28
some dumbbells and work on the movement
00:29:32
pattern and stuff work on adding weight
00:29:34
putting weight on the back when he or
00:29:36
she is ready and feel strong okay good
00:29:38
job
00:29:54
[Applause]
00:29:57
okay sorry guys um which squats are best
00:30:03
for bowlegged people Yvonne
00:30:05
Maria Santana asks I mean it's far as a
00:30:10
high bar you loose a low bar spot I'm
00:30:12
like really start with your low bar
00:30:13
that's I think that's probably going to
00:30:16
be the best that's gonna help you really
00:30:17
it's hard to be bowlegged or that
00:30:19
affecting it all your squats if you're
00:30:21
pushing your hips back we're gonna low
00:30:24
bar it's better suggestion um yeah I
00:30:28
miss this but can you show us some of
00:30:29
effective hip mobility warm-ups yes we
00:30:31
can do that hang on you guys are welcome
00:30:34
thank you okay Pete Levesque is what
00:30:39
stance would you suggest for a 36 inch
00:30:41
inseam my knees travel past big toes
00:30:44
enough to do a wide stance why it stands
00:30:46
to be out at a 45 degrees and use my
00:30:48
adapters I have run on dreamers so I
00:30:51
totally totally feel your pain my
00:30:53
adaptors were somewhere like every time
00:30:55
that I do squats really because you're
00:30:58
tall like squatting is gonna be hard for
00:31:01
you like that's just that's what's gonna
00:31:04
suck about it um I
00:31:06
put the bar lower on my back again if I
00:31:09
were I don't know if you're doing that
00:31:10
and that will help sort of negate having
00:31:13
to be so so wide because they're gonna
00:31:17
come back a little bit further so if
00:31:19
you're super wide and you're coming down
00:31:21
that turns these on in here you come
00:31:23
back a little bit further that might
00:31:25
help you having long legs is just it's a
00:31:31
really long range of motion so it's
00:31:32
always going to be a little bit more
00:31:33
difficult for you not impossible but
00:31:35
again play with the bar where the bar is
00:31:36
on their back and play with pushing your
00:31:38
hips back go in that might help what if
00:31:41
you had that knees and that hurts you I
00:31:43
talked about this before
00:31:46
squatting isn't necessarily bad for your
00:31:48
knees and put on some nice leaves ask a
00:31:51
doctor Petey if you have an injury you
00:31:54
have an injury don't do it that's part
00:31:59
of athletics really is some some aches
00:32:01
and pains train through it if you want
00:32:03
to if it hurts you bad you don't have to
00:32:04
do spots there's no the squat dogs
00:32:07
aren't going to come smite you doesn't
00:32:08
it
00:32:09
um thank you guys
00:32:16
how can I dominate the Olympia and
00:32:19
Sheldon 18 James Murphy you ask that's a
00:32:22
good question
00:32:24
man I don't know the answer how much do
00:32:27
you weight girls
FSG seven
00:32:35
sorry guys you asked me so many good
00:32:36
questions I'm sure you look up or
00:32:38
straight Trevor Griffin good question
00:32:39
should I look up or straight forward
00:32:41
when squatting look straight forward for
00:32:42
some reason every football coach in
00:32:45
America teaches his kids to do this
00:32:50
worst advice ever
00:32:52
this is like the worst thing for your
00:32:53
neck your spine the point really in the
00:32:56
backs one particular thing is more part
00:32:57
of the low bar spot in particular is
00:32:59
more important
have a look maybe like sports scene for
00:33:03
any good I'm looking at the bottom of
00:33:05
the rib right here when I sweat and I'm
00:33:07
going to try to keep that head angle the
00:33:10
whole time yes it's weird
00:33:11
yes you can't look at yourself in the
00:33:13
mirror learn what your body's doing you
00:33:16
shouldn't have to look at yourself when
00:33:17
you do it keep your head as neutral as
00:33:19
possible I think you're doing a high bar
00:33:21
spot looking for it a little bit it's
00:33:23
probably going to be more likely don't
00:33:25
look up just don't there's nothing I
00:33:28
don't know why football do you asks my
00:33:38
right note gets numb Wow my right arm
00:33:40
gets numb what's the reason on the back
00:33:43
squat I imagine if summers shoulder
00:33:45
issue that's very strange I would go get
00:33:49
that checked out that shouldn't happen
00:33:51
in this mission if if if you're okay not
00:33:55
doing
00:33:56
spots of try from spotting the show this
00:33:59
is definitely more for your quadriceps
00:34:01
than it is for your up your boots and
00:34:05
hamstrings but your glutes and
00:34:06
hamstrings will turn on this this
00:34:08
position might help you a little bit
00:34:09
better if you if it hurts your shoulders
00:34:12
to have your arms back here so I would
00:34:14
suggest trying the front spot issue
00:34:18
difference one is going to be mobility
00:34:19
Dean obviously has some mobility issues
00:34:22
but this is going to help so if you
00:34:24
can't hold on to it we clean style of
00:34:26
just fold your arms and do it this way
00:34:28
same thing
00:34:30
Dean's got a really nice straight back
00:34:34
he's pushing back with his hips and he's
00:34:36
standing straight up his head is nice
00:34:38
and neutral or just facing forward yes
00:34:42
there you go
00:34:44
put feet on outer sides of heels to
00:34:47
prevent this make sure you mean Daniel
00:34:50
that's too exaggerated which gives me
00:34:57
which is better front or back spot
00:34:59
completely depends again on on your goal
00:35:02
you're not going to squat as much a week
00:35:04
under Francois as you would for a basket
00:35:06
but I totally suggest putting both of
00:35:08
them in your program if you want to
00:35:11
learn how to do it clean you have to
00:35:12
front spot is if you're at the bottom
00:35:14
here and you want to get up you're gonna
00:35:16
have to be even half different spot
00:35:17
because I'm essentially what a clean
00:35:19
this again a fun spot it's gonna put
00:35:23
more pressure I mean you're gonna use
00:35:25
your quads more but it doesn't mean
00:35:27
you're not going to use your hamstrings
00:35:28
and your clips what's unknown about
00:35:31
squats in general is actually it's a
00:35:33
really good before I don't want to say
00:35:36
workout or you're gonna be a check for
00:35:38
hugely so what are the functions of your
00:35:40
core is anti flexion and anti extension
00:35:43
and that your course purpose is really
00:35:45
to keep you upright so if you can have
00:35:47
weight on the front of your body right
00:35:49
here without your core you just like to
00:35:51
collapse forward same thing if it's on
00:35:53
your back
00:35:54
you'd either fall backwards or I've been
00:35:57
going over your back you could collapse
00:35:58
forward if you have a weak core
00:36:02
squatting heavy is going to be really
00:36:04
difficult for you and that's why you see
00:36:05
a lot of people when they're squatting
00:36:07
they come but first and then it's
00:36:13
generally a core issue it's a little
00:36:16
thing that we need to talk about that if
00:36:18
you're squatting again I told
00:36:20
just to have your friend or your buddy
00:36:22
like film you get your phone out film
00:36:26
you doing your squats and if you're
00:36:27
doing this strip the stripper squat or
00:36:30
you're doing this stop what you're doing
00:36:35
take the weight off the bar and like we
00:36:38
learned how to squat push that restart
00:36:40
button on the computer no one's watching
00:36:42
and nobody cares well that was a good
00:36:48
question how do you set up an overhead
00:36:52
squat so this is a really good question
00:36:55
so the purpose of an overhead squat I
00:36:59
think unless you are doing weightless
00:37:02
finger CrossFit is really a mobility
00:37:04
exercise so we need to do is he's gonna
00:37:07
put the bar on his back he's gonna put
00:37:10
his head in this where he would in this
00:37:13
match which is wider he's gonna push it
00:37:16
push press it up push jerking up and
00:37:19
he's gonna do this same kind of good
00:37:21
squat mush and he'll be working out he's
00:37:22
gonna push his hips back and he's gonna
00:37:25
try to keep the bar right over the top
00:37:27
of his head if you are new to doing this
00:37:32
good job Tina i 100% don't think you
00:37:36
should do anything other just don't
00:37:39
there's no reason to do that if you are
00:37:41
a hyper mobile person you can move your
00:37:44
hands closer in you can do it that way
00:37:47
but the same sort of rules applied in
00:37:50
overheads
it can be more difficult because your
00:37:53
mobility and most people your t-spine is
00:37:55
probably my type because you're used to
00:37:57
being forward on your computer all the
00:37:58
time being up and out and open it's
00:38:01
really hard to do same thing though you
00:38:03
want to keep your your chest high you
00:38:05
want to keep your butt back you just
00:38:07
spend this time you're huge ready to be
00:38:08
over your head
00:38:10
lightweight and less your mobile and you
00:38:12
know what you're doing and you can have
00:38:13
a strong back in court but that's a
00:38:16
really good question do you need to wear
00:38:19
the belt when you're doing squats by
00:38:21
diet that's a really good question too
00:38:23
in my so this is what a belt looks like
00:38:27
to me in those streaks athletes I would
00:38:30
say you do not put a belt on unless
00:38:31
you're going over 80% if you don't train
00:38:35
that way if you don't train based on a
00:38:39
percentage and you just do back squats
00:38:41
as part of your leg leg day I don't
00:38:45
think you need to know unless you're I
00:38:46
mean unless you're going for it one rep
00:38:48
max so you're three rep max and maybe
00:38:49
even your five rep max um let your core
00:38:53
do what it's supposed to do this and a
00:38:56
lot of people think that a belt is
00:38:57
actually to help your back which is true
00:39:00
but it helps your back because a vel
00:39:03
gives your abs something to press
00:39:05
against which can make it what's the
00:39:09
right word which increases the tension
00:39:11
that makes sense and can make swag
00:39:13
coming up a little bit easier but that's
00:39:16
the purpose of a belt it's not to for
00:39:19
some reason I don't know like put
00:39:20
pressure on your back it's actually
00:39:21
pushing it so you can push your stomach
00:39:23
forward which kid will leave pressure on
00:39:25
their back
00:39:26
it's appointment so a lot of the time we
00:39:29
don't see belts like this one kind of
00:39:30
where it's fatter in the backs and in
00:39:32
the front that's not necessarily what
00:39:34
you need to look for you look for
00:39:35
something that is the same length all
00:39:38
the way around and it's a Widow's okay
00:39:41
totally up to you if you back squat
00:39:44
often you'll know when you need to put
00:39:46
the belt on my general rule is over 80%
00:39:48
anything less than that you can handle
00:39:50
it without good question though okay
00:39:56
belt is knowing we got there should the
00:39:59
hips go down until 90 degrees or way
00:40:01
more down okay
00:40:03
depends on your I would say if at 90
00:40:07
degrees really is right where the
00:40:09
tension is worst on release a little bit
00:40:12
below that's actually going to help your
00:40:13
musculature turn on so you can actually
00:40:16
not have so much pressure on your knees
00:40:18
so no don't stop at 90 degrees go until
00:40:23
your hips your hip creases below your
00:40:26
knees that doesn't mean you have to be
00:40:28
down here you can still be right here I
00:40:31
can't see myself so this might be the
00:40:32
right spot okay a suppress what there's
00:40:37
really I mean if you can't if you
00:40:39
mobility prevents
00:40:41
if you want to put on some heavy heavy
00:40:42
weight you don't have to go after grass
00:40:45
there's no like no gots spots don't care
00:40:48
while God's just care that you care just
00:40:49
care that you're squatting will maygene
00:40:54
you why would you wear that all you'll
00:40:55
be okay
00:40:58
deadlift question mark you should
00:41:01
deadlift deadlifting is good good
00:41:04
question
00:41:05
we love you girls how to increase ankle
00:41:10
dorsiflexion okay so ankle mobility is a
00:41:14
really big deal for squatting friend
00:41:17
squatting if you would be an Olympic
00:41:19
weightlifter you're gonna need good
00:41:29
Saudis gonna do here is gonna lean
00:41:31
forward he's gonna put your chest with
00:41:33
me he's gonna try to crush himself he's
00:41:38
been jepty he's basically gonna try to
00:41:40
crush his me down
00:41:41
so she's stretching out his ankles
00:41:45
effort as I feel so this is actually got
00:41:47
really good mobility which is probably
00:41:49
why he goes his friends
00:41:50
so well that is great do that really any
00:41:55
sort of movement just even then
00:41:57
stretching your calves like this this
00:42:01
will do it but the point is to challenge
00:42:03
just like I don't know if you've ever
00:42:06
taken a really hardcore II don't good
00:42:07
class where they're like I don't know
00:42:10
something because it like - it feels
00:42:11
good
00:42:12
don't go further double by and then
00:42:14
there's something because you've got a
00:42:15
challenge to move me right so that's
00:42:18
what I do want to go for a hardcore yoga
00:42:19
class so you're gonna pull yourself into
00:42:22
whatever you're doing whatever stretch
00:42:23
you're doing try to do the part and then
00:42:26
change the position try to bend your
00:42:27
knee a little bit
00:42:28
pull yourself into it the point of
00:42:32
stretching for mobility purposes this is
00:42:35
a challenge to make it difficult and yes
00:42:37
there's yoga stretching and then there's
00:42:40
more hardcore and if you want better
00:42:42
mobility for your angles in particular
00:42:45
if you have to crush up and yeah hurts
00:42:47
but wait
00:42:50
she is asking really good questions
00:42:53
should you vary the position of your
00:42:55
feet toes out toes and feet out ok again
00:43:00
I don't know the research on this that
00:43:03
like you're gonna have any different
00:43:05
quad development depending on where your
00:43:07
feet are in your squat I honestly I I
00:43:11
don't know I think that's kind of silly
00:43:13
that if your work if you're trying to
00:43:15
like work different angles of your quads
00:43:17
doing squats with like your feet face
00:43:19
other ways like there's much more
00:43:21
efficient ways to do that and like I'm
00:43:24
not sure and if it's worth putting your
00:43:26
feet in a bad position to like turn on
00:43:29
your basses Niehaus it don't make sense
00:43:35
you can do it if you want to close it my
00:43:38
suggest is if you're playing with your
00:43:40
feet like do it for the purpose of a
00:43:44
good squat position not four o'clock
00:43:47
Bachman okay
00:43:50
[Music]
00:43:53
maybe teach what an isometric
00:43:56
contraction is might help clarify ome of
00:43:58
my spots work your core okay good
00:44:02
question
let's do that to make that a little bit
00:44:04
more applicable to squat so we'll talk
00:44:07
about breathing in general for squats
00:44:09
particularly if you have a heavy heavy
00:44:12
weight on the bar but even if not
00:44:14
there's a good way to breathe in the
00:44:15
squats my badness so we need steps up
00:44:20
he's gonna take one two steps three he's
00:44:23
gonna fix his feet that's fine he's
00:44:26
going to take a big breath in and he's
00:44:29
gonna push down in his belly like he's
00:44:31
pooping weirdly enough so you know push
00:44:34
in his belly he's going to hold that you
00:44:37
can breathe sorry he's actually gonna
00:44:39
hold that breath and if he had a belt on
00:44:42
here he would be pushing into that belt
00:44:43
he's gonna hold that breath as it comes
00:44:45
down and then there's way up you can let
00:44:49
it out holding that breath actually
00:44:53
keeps your core tighter it's going to
00:44:56
help you stabilize
00:45:00
so if you are our breathing the whole
00:45:06
time like if you're like it's much more
00:45:10
likely that you're going to have some
00:45:11
issues coming forward or like rumbling
00:45:15
forward if your core isn't contracted
00:45:17
that makes sense so the best way to keep
00:45:25
your core contracted by pushing outward
00:45:28
and then coming down hold your breath
00:45:30
and yeah they might get diseased their
00:45:32
speech becomes like lots of weight on
00:45:34
the bar if you are not used if you're
00:45:36
like even you're aware grab a partner if
00:45:42
you're doing really heavy squats have
00:45:43
them help you if you're if you get
00:45:45
lightheaded in the squat let's play with
00:45:48
your breathing but it's that's worth
00:45:51
doing if you look on a power different
00:45:55
platform if you're trying to get PR
00:45:56
other than that like if this happens if
00:45:58
you're just
00:45:59
that's up to five when you're getting
00:46:00
dizzy every time like let's chill up and
00:46:03
breathe don't forget to breathe
00:46:04
definitely breathe out on the way if you
00:46:07
can take a couple of rest and then go
00:46:11
again that makes sense but the point
00:46:14
I'll get to your question in this deck a
00:46:16
really good point is to not just hold
00:46:18
your breath
but contract' your stomach like you're
00:46:20
looping question good question mark from
00:46:33
YouTube does high reps and low weight
00:46:35
help with fat burning for squats the
00:46:41
answers okay so if you're if you're in
00:46:46
the business of losing weight the thing
00:46:49
you need to focus on is your nutrition
00:46:52
that's what matters what you do in the
00:46:55
gym is literally like a tiny portion of
00:46:59
the weight loss equation yes working out
00:47:03
is healthy everyone should do it you
00:47:05
need to move it doesn't matter if you
00:47:06
were in the gym if you're out hiking if
00:47:08
your skier or whatever you do movement
00:47:10
matters for weight loss matters most
00:47:14
doing in the kitchen so I know you don't
00:47:18
mean to like this miss your question
00:47:19
like it it doesn't matter you could do
00:47:23
either one squats if your your nutrition
00:47:25
is on track how do you exercise with
00:47:28
your slots really isn't gonna matter so
00:47:30
the answer is yes and um
00:47:32
do whatever you want with the squat eat
00:47:34
well wow you guys are asking some good
00:47:40
questions okay Gary okay here anything
00:47:45
will ask you about entrance should you
00:47:47
pause between reps or keep going until
00:47:48
you hit your rep total pause between
00:47:51
reps breathe there's no reason to do to
00:47:55
these squats especially if you have
00:47:57
weight on your back like what like why
00:47:58
can you show them what up non-breathing
00:48:02
weird
00:48:04
these are spots
00:48:10
there's truly in my mind like no reason
00:48:13
to do that this is how it should load
00:48:15
your sets
00:48:23
perfect they should look like that set
00:48:26
to it I mean unless I even like even
00:48:31
across that where you do weird like
00:48:33
heavy reps for for time you still don't
00:48:36
do speed squats you them quickly but
00:48:38
you're still focused on good form and
00:48:40
good breathing to keep your core
00:48:42
contracted so you don't crumble yourself
00:48:44
forward and you threw yourself that
00:48:46
makes sense
00:48:47
so take your time there's no doesn't
00:48:50
matter I have been lifting for thirty
00:48:52
plus years and you were very good at
00:48:53
explaining thank you so much Gary let's
00:48:56
see what else what's good mobility Gary
00:48:59
again Gary different Gary what's a good
00:49:02
mobility exercise for getting under the
00:49:04
bar for a low bar squats do you mean
00:49:08
like your back getting under it or your
00:49:13
shoulders that might be an issue
00:49:15
shoulder mobility is a huge problem
00:49:17
again working that work on those
00:49:19
overhead squats any stretching I really
00:49:23
like to do this for you
00:49:29
I like this and put however your friends
00:49:32
put weight not like to sit on you but
00:49:34
like a bit plate right here higher than
00:49:37
you think not down here but here and
00:49:38
then hang out there for a minute or two
00:49:40
just let that sink right in you can also
00:49:43
get you company them you can also do
00:49:45
even here and then come forward this is
00:49:50
more like pick peck stretchy but this is
00:49:53
definitely going to help you with if you
00:49:54
struggle like if this position in
00:49:56
general it's difficult for you if you're
00:50:00
way out here or you have to hold here
00:50:02
which I don't understand you need to
00:50:06
work on their mobility that's a question
00:50:08
I have for you why do people put their
00:50:11
hands weight high out here when they're
00:50:13
somebody really mean that okay when it
00:50:21
gets hard but my legs go a little bit
00:50:25
inside and it gets easier to get up Wow
00:50:28
I don't
00:50:29
is it better should I put less weight so
00:50:32
if your knees are collapsing that's
00:50:34
natural that's gonna happen so if you're
00:50:35
here I need to collapse a little bit and
00:50:37
you come up just make sure you're
00:50:39
pushing them out as you come up but it's
00:50:42
especially it's much more like like food
00:50:44
ivar squad because you're going down so
00:50:46
low that you either going to collapse it
00:50:47
if you're doing a little bar squat it's
00:50:49
probably less likely that your knees are
00:50:50
gonna collapse so that will happen
00:50:52
that's okay your goal your job is to
00:50:55
push your knees back out on the way up
00:50:57
you can also take weight up and use this
00:51:02
hashtag mark about mark fellow rules hip
00:51:07
circle keep that tension on your on your
00:51:09
you literally can't push get your knees
00:51:11
to push in if you're keeping tension on
00:51:14
the band the whole time okay shouldn't
00:51:18
the breath be held until the top of the
00:51:20
motion if if you want to I mean
00:51:25
sometimes it's really hard especially
00:51:26
brewing really having to hold your
00:51:27
breath the entire spot I mean for me in
00:51:31
general I usually hold my breath and
00:51:33
tell them about here and then I let now
00:51:36
because I get stuck for me personally in
00:51:40
a spa I get stuck here so to keep my
00:51:43
pressure keep everything going on in my
00:51:45
car I usually hold it hold my breath
00:51:47
alone and then up it depends I highly
00:51:53
suggest that you don't get down to the
00:51:55
bottom let it out and then try to
00:51:57
back up hold it till you're on the way
00:52:00
up but you don't have to fold it into
00:52:02
later at the top unless you get stuck
00:52:06
here which is unlikely I think once you
00:52:08
get to this position you can call me
00:52:10
come back good question
00:52:13
question from YouTube how do you build
00:52:23
great legs with a herniated disc Wow
00:52:27
okay probably don't do this take
00:52:32
advantage of the myriad exercise
00:52:35
machines happening I mean I think I'm
00:52:36
leg press might hurts your doctor
00:52:41
ask your doctor he or she what you
00:52:44
should do a really cool exercise that
00:52:48
I've seen is like you put your feet on
00:52:50
boxes and you put like a dip belt on and
00:52:53
you put weight and then you squat this
00:52:55
so it's just weight on your hips and you
00:52:57
squat this way and that takes that
00:52:59
relieves all the pressure from your back
00:53:01
it's all just hanging on your hips
00:53:03
that'd be a good way for you to go you
00:53:07
can do pull weight at your sides when
00:53:11
you're doing stuff yeah I would have
00:53:14
touched it up and just play with play
00:53:16
with like movements of the the weights
00:53:18
not on your back it might be a great way
00:53:21
to do it and you can still she feels
00:53:24
great quads at weights might just take a
00:53:26
little bit of extra work but not
00:53:29
impossible
good question
00:53:32
Sean asks is there a to work out my legs
00:53:34
today if I work them out two days ago
00:53:36
yes it is sure is when should I use I
00:53:40
like shoes I suggest using them whenever
00:53:44
you want to I've seen people use them
00:53:47
with a low bar squat I've seen people
00:53:49
use them with a high bar squat but if
00:53:51
you really if you feel more comfortable
00:53:53
if it's easier for you then put them on
00:53:55
there's no again the squat gods don't
00:53:57
care if you have all these shoes on or
00:53:59
not if you can afford them they can be
00:54:02
spending by more what hey I know I don't
00:54:06
think we're the only reason why not good
00:54:08
question
00:54:10
okay Noah says my arms out oh you
00:54:14
answered my question thank you because
00:54:16
he is very tied to my chest and shoulder
00:54:19
to plus carpal tunnel syndrome means
00:54:20
tendons are tight in your elbow so just
00:54:23
bending it is uncomfortable that I would
00:54:26
work on that chest chest circle okay
00:54:32
great matthew ray Goodson asks you
00:54:35
mentioned pushing your hips back to
00:54:36
initiate spots could you demonstrate the
00:54:38
difference between initiating with the
00:54:40
hips and tilting your hips AKA anterior
00:54:42
pelvic tilt common fog okay oh yeah we
00:54:47
we can do this again since we're yeah we
00:54:49
did this a little bit better grab the
00:54:51
bar okay so you gonna do first a high
00:54:54
bar spot this is a high bar spot can you
00:55:00
hang out a little bit this angle is
00:55:04
short acute acute but he's tall here his
00:55:09
head's facing forward this is what a
00:55:11
high bar spot ready should look like at
00:55:13
the bottom so a lot of people struggle
00:55:18
when they do a squat is a their hips
00:55:21
pull under that's called a butt wink
00:55:26
that were anterior pelvic tilt indeed
00:55:28
it's a hard time 30 Cal sir I can do it
00:55:30
so hundreds Lonnie and if it comes up
00:55:33
underneath like that that can be that
00:55:35
can cause a lot of pressure and your
00:55:37
lower back and your hips that can that
00:55:39
curb that's usually why people's if your
00:55:41
lower back hurts when you're spotting
00:55:42
that's generally because as you're
00:55:44
squatting your hips are tucking under
00:55:46
00:55:47
under or when you come down if that
00:55:51
happens I suggest you don't go that low
00:55:56
film yourself doing this glut watch or
00:55:59
your body's doing go down only as far
00:56:01
like let's say D need to stop here
00:56:03
that's fine you don't have to go up
00:56:07
stress do what's safe and good for your
00:56:09
body
at this moment and work on it on your
00:56:12
mobility and your strength and it
00:56:15
and then so then in between a show a
00:56:16
love our spot these traps here he's
00:56:22
gonna so it's going to be different
00:56:23
about this as his hips are going to come
00:56:24
back more toward me the heads gonna be a
00:56:26
little more neutral it's gonna feel
00:56:28
brave because you're gonna bend forward
00:56:30
a little bit more so these angles here
00:56:33
it must be cute and here it goes like
00:56:37
you are safe right here is different
00:56:38
these are bigger here that's put a
00:56:41
little bit smaller which is fine and
00:56:43
honestly to me if you're if you're a
00:56:45
noob and you have mobility issues this
00:56:47
is a much better choice for your squat
00:56:50
good job because it's just just easier
00:56:55
for your body to be in that position
00:56:56
again it turns your glutes and
00:56:59
hamstrings on arguably a little bit
00:57:00
better than a high bar squat and if you
00:57:03
practice it a lot you can probably get
00:57:06
eke out maybe 5% more weight wise by the
00:57:10
low bar so high that you can a high bar
00:57:11
spot but again that completely depends
00:57:14
on like who's doing this wedding if
00:57:16
you're a pro power lifter
00:57:19
yeah you're gonna clearly do a lot more
00:57:22
because that's the kind of squat that
00:57:23
you're gonna work with okay which
00:57:28
question
00:57:32
our Congress choose a good alternative
00:57:34
to lifting shoes well they're not
00:57:36
necessarily an alternative so I'm gonna
00:57:39
grab Dean's up teaching this has a heel
00:57:44
on it
00:57:47
the reason this helps is it just puts
00:57:50
because it's tall it puts your foot in a
00:57:54
more ergonomically helpful position to
00:57:58
put the rest of your body in a better
00:58:00
position to squat so the Congress is not
00:58:04
necessarily an alternative because the
00:58:05
Congress doesn't have a feel converse is
00:58:07
just flat so if you have mobility ankle
00:58:12
mobility issues this might be a better
00:58:15
option however there is the argument you
00:58:17
can make that if you have a mobility
00:58:19
issues the best way to combat those a
00:58:21
global reality issues is to squat in a
00:58:24
hard position for your body if you
00:58:27
continue to want a little shoes like
00:58:28
this and it hurts there's a good chance
00:58:31
it's going to get better over time
00:58:32
so alternative is the wrong word option
00:58:36
yes you can you can wear whatever you
00:58:39
wear bare feet you can wear socks you
00:58:43
can wear those gross shoes and just like
00:58:45
the toe shoes you wear those but yeah
00:58:49
that's just going to depend entirely on
00:58:51
if you if you truly are like that
00:58:54
concerned about your squat performance
00:58:56
then I would
00:58:57
invest in these if you're squatting
00:58:59
again just to be happy and healthy and
00:59:01
like move well than just like wear
00:59:03
whatever you have on except squishy
00:59:06
shoes shoes that are squishy that have
00:59:08
like squishy heels
00:59:09
do not wear those if you have good
00:59:12
issues and their ankles collapse in or
00:59:14
out that's probably because your shoes
00:59:15
don't have enough
00:59:17
they're just you squishing there's like
00:59:19
not enough can't be on the floor now
00:59:22
okay moving on good question which do
00:59:30
you recommend squat on the Smith machine
00:59:31
or normal don't use a Smith's machine
00:59:32
ever I hate that machine if you're on
00:59:38
the Smith machine that's gonna make your
00:59:40
body being a really particular position
00:59:43
00:59:44
and then this that doesn't necessarily
00:59:45
mean that you're that you're you've got
00:59:48
the bar will be over your center of mass
00:59:49
so a lot of times people are on a smith
00:59:52
machine yes you can do it the other way
00:59:55
if that's a fear for the city so this is
00:59:57
pretend deeds on a smith machine this is
00:59:59
how you have to squat which makes like
01:00:02
literally no sense in the real world and
01:00:05
it's again okay so this is just a
01:00:08
difference of opinion in terms of why
01:00:11
you exercise if you're working out for
01:00:15
bodybuilding only
01:00:17
and you're not concerned about how your
01:00:19
body moves in space then ensure use a
01:00:22
smith machine I don't think you're gonna
01:00:25
get as much muscle stimulation I don't
01:00:27
think you're gonna grow as much but if
01:00:29
it makes you feel better use it if you
01:00:31
are working out to move well to like run
01:00:34
away from zombies or fight them or like
01:00:37
climb a tree
01:00:38
I don't know play with your children use
01:00:40
a regular barbell okay that's my long
01:00:43
answer no again our spots okay for
01:00:50
people with flat feet or should they
01:00:51
wear their supports in their trainers
01:00:53
instead of barefoot yeah it doesn't
01:00:54
matter what I'm going to be you have as
01:00:56
long as your ankles you know as long as
01:00:58
you're not collapsing in on yourself and
01:01:00
night when you're squatting you're like
01:01:02
not like this you're going to be fine I
01:01:04
don't think the type of feet you have is
01:01:05
gonna change how you squat I mean
01:01:08
there's some argument I have the flat
01:01:09
fee money Tony on us is going pair a
01:01:16
little good enough for muscle growth yes
01:01:20
sure yes
01:01:23
again what is the purpose of your squats
01:01:25
if you're just doing it to grow a muscle
01:01:28
I think you could probably argue that
01:01:32
you would get more muscle stimulation
01:01:34
going a little bit lower and again
01:01:36
parallel it's actually harder on your
01:01:38
knees and going out a little bit below
01:01:39
parallel that's my response I am like an
01:01:45
anti parallel sweater as part of just
01:01:48
the kind of athlete I am but like I
01:01:50
think the world in general puts too much
01:01:55
pressure on their knees doing parallel
01:01:56
squats go a little bit you don't have to
01:01:58
01:01:59
go a crs again make sure your your hip
01:02:01
crease is a little bit below your knee
01:02:03
crease and you're good to go
01:02:04
that'll turn on your button your
01:02:06
hamstrings a little bit better okay but
01:02:10
see Vicky asked I'm skinny but with a
01:02:12
tummy when I lift weight I lose weight
01:02:15
so what can I do to lose the tummy but
01:02:18
not the body weight again it's going to
01:02:21
be nutrition it doesn't matter what
01:02:22
you're doing in the gym doesn't matter
01:02:24
if you're exercising keeping out of the
01:02:26
gym it's matters entirely in what you're
01:02:27
doing in the kitchen and body fats where
01:02:31
it ends up on your body if
01:02:33
design your genetics some of us carry it
01:02:36
here a lot of boys area right here
01:02:38
women usually carry in their button size
01:02:42
you have to be patient and just really
01:02:45
work on your nutrition whatever
01:02:53
it's been in an hour so how about any
01:02:56
last questions I'm sorry if I didn't get
01:02:59
if I didn't get everybody's questions
01:03:02
I'm sorry let's see last there's more
01:03:08
let's do a speed question questionable
01:03:13
one more dance question okay so this is
01:03:16
just a fun game we're going to do speed
01:03:18
questions you asked me questions and I
01:03:20
can only answer in like one or two words
01:03:22
or deep testing derivatives nutrition
01:03:26
fitness bodybuilding in CrossFit twelve
01:03:29
questions all the above ready you go
01:03:33
will this be available to watch yes come
01:03:36
back
01:03:38
do I like nachos hell yeah can you open
01:03:42
relays what's a good set and reps yes
01:03:45
you can over train here's here's a good
01:03:48
way to think about it if you constantly
01:03:51
this is not one right answer if you
01:03:52
constantly can't sleep at night because
01:03:54
your body hurts too bad I mean you're
01:03:56
overtraining that could happen that
01:03:58
happens me
01:03:59
how doesn't even once in a while if
01:04:01
that's a consistent thing Europe dream
01:04:04
[Music]
01:04:05
best one roofer squat is and here's why
01:04:08
with that sucker or you can do a little
01:04:11
monster box this way this way this way
01:04:21
if you're overweight slash Alicia do
01:04:24
strength team absolutely no reason
01:04:26
anyone should not lift weights your body
01:04:29
has this is not one right answer if your
01:04:32
body hot summer muscle your body has fit
01:04:35
basically burns more fat so build muscle
01:04:37
the building muscle is good for you it's
01:04:39
gonna help everything if you if you lift
01:04:42
weights we help your joints it's gonna
01:04:44
help your bones yeah there's no reason
01:04:46
not to be it might be difficult for you
01:04:49
to move well with extra weight so it
01:04:51
might be easier for you to get a little
01:04:53
bit of weight off by walking it's going
01:04:56
to be your nutrition 100% all the time
01:04:58
nutrition first walk unless you feel
01:05:01
comfortable I can move well you get a
01:05:05
little weight off and then to start
01:05:06
stretching but there's no reason you
01:05:07
should now if you feel about doing
01:05:12
[Music]
01:05:13
protein to vegan pretty good question if
01:05:18
it hurts your belly to acquaint bothers
01:05:20
your belly donate wait I like do you use
01:05:27
testosterone supplements personally no
01:05:30
yes it's pretty crazy
01:05:35
even steroids
01:05:39
should I wear my baseball cap backwards
01:05:41
to be more aerodynamic squatting yes
01:05:43
that helps for sure the gym can't see
01:05:50
your quads you're doing something yes
01:05:56
damn t10 DT 10 no spaces no spaces my
01:06:01
name is Cassie a Smith's Cassie Gaines
01:06:04
been training should I shave my beard
01:06:19
will help me in the gym
01:06:21
yeah I keep them I think here helps
01:06:25
increase testosterone
01:06:35
don't do
01:06:45
we're gonna have a stronger Goldeneye
01:07:22
let's see if that's about time under
01:07:24
tension that's hard to do with one word
01:07:27
time under tension is good it's good I
01:07:32
mean here's the thing again about
01:07:36
movement patterns if if you think doing
01:07:39
like quarter reps of things to keep your
01:07:43
muscle under tension the whole time
01:07:45
depending on the movement biceps curls
01:07:47
like do everyone but like to me doing a
01:07:51
movement
it's supposed to be done and doing it
01:07:53
well is more important than to me then
01:07:57
like how much vasodilation and pump I
01:08:01
get but that is a personal choice so you
01:08:06
do you boo boo scared to fall down on
01:08:12
the squat that's a super common fear
01:08:15
01:08:16
there are things you can do grab a buddy
01:08:18
take weight off and also learn how to
01:08:21
bail we can have a whole nother video
01:08:24
tutorial yeah baby we can show it yes
01:08:33
squats are what's are one of those
01:08:40
movements that use almost all of the
01:08:42
muscles in your body squats are also
01:08:45
great for women because they are it's a
01:08:47
bone loading exercise coaching women in
01:08:51
general have worked time with them and
01:08:57
efficiency and they get older so doing
01:08:59
squats is great yes do women men
01:09:02
so this is how you bail on the spot
01:09:04
she's going going I can't get up

01:09:14
if you want to show again not scary it's
01:09:33
