00:00:00
the squat is possibly the most useful
00:00:04
and functional exercise out there today
00:00:06
i want to share a 30-day plan that you
00:00:09
can use to improve your legs strength
00:00:12
endurance and mobility
00:00:16
so over the last 10 years i've done a
00:00:19
lot of squatting from barbell variations
00:00:22
to then moving into body weight more
00:00:25
challenging single leg variations but
00:00:27
the focus has always been on intensity
00:00:31
either more weight on the bar or a
00:00:33
harder variation but over the last few
00:00:35
00:00:36
months i took on a new experiment and
00:00:38
that was to do
00:00:39
the basic two leg body weight squat now
00:00:42
be honest in the past
00:00:44
i thought this was too basic for me but
00:00:47
what i found is that i was overlooking a
00:00:49
huge component of fitness and that's
00:00:52
building a bigger base of strength
00:00:55
capacity with the basics so the results
00:00:58
have been this i've had more endurance
00:01:01
for things like walking hiking and
00:01:03
running i've actually been quite
00:01:05
surprised how much more pep in my step
00:01:08
i've had on longer hikes it's easier to
00:01:11
access the deep squat position it's
00:01:13
simple if you spend more time in a
00:01:16
position your body will allow you to go
00:01:18
there easier and this has made my ankles
00:01:21
knees and hips feel really good and
00:01:23
lastly less overall fatigue the
00:01:26
bodyweight squat is not very demanding
00:01:29
on your system so you can do it more
00:01:31
often and still be fresh for other
00:01:33
activities and if you're anything like
00:01:35
me it's been ingrained into you that leg
00:01:38
day means you should be walking out of
00:01:40
the gym with
00:01:41
wobbly legs and sore for the next three
00:01:44
days but for those of us that value
00:01:46
feeling good and being active every day
00:01:49
it's a poor mindset seeking more
00:01:51
strength with less fatigue allows us to
00:01:54
be more useful in everyday life so what
00:01:57
are the negatives to this style of
00:01:58
training
00:01:59
well you're not going to have
00:02:02
bodybuilder legs you need more
00:02:04
resistance for that and you might not be
00:02:06
able to lift a car up just from doing
00:02:08
bodyweight squats but assuming that
00:02:10
those aren't your goals let's dive into
00:02:13
this plan so you're going to pick a
00:02:15
number of squats that just starts to
00:02:17
fatigue you on the last rep or two
00:02:20
because your legs support you all day
00:02:22
long they're already fairly strong so
00:02:25
this number should be higher than say
00:02:28
your pull-ups maybe 10
00:02:30
15 20 even 30. for me i landed on 20
00:02:34
reps being comfortable
00:02:36
but just causing the slightest fatigue
00:02:39
at rep 20. now choose a number of days
00:02:42
per week to do your squats i'd recommend
00:02:45
three but if you have a strong base you
00:02:47
can do four
00:02:49
if you're a true beginner you might even
00:02:51
just do two now begin with just two sets
00:02:55
of your squats per day on the first week
00:02:58
this should be very easy and almost feel
00:03:00
like not enough now each week you'll add
00:03:03
an additional set per day so for me week
00:03:07
one i did two sets of 20 reps three days
00:03:11
per week now by week four i was doing
00:03:15
five sets of 20 reps 3 days per week so
00:03:18
i went from a total of 120 reps on that
00:03:22
first week to 300 reps on week 4. your
00:03:26
body loves it when you gradually
00:03:29
increase the volume over time and once
00:03:31
00:03:32
again you shouldn't be getting too sore
00:03:35
or causing too much fatigue because of
00:03:37
this gradual ramp up now here's where we
00:03:40
get even more out of these squats
00:03:43
at the end of each set i want you to
00:03:45
00:03:46
stand up you can kind of shake out your
00:03:47
00:03:48
legs for a sec and then sit back down
00:03:50
into the bottom of your squat position
00:03:52
for at least a minute the best time to
00:03:55
establish your deep squat position is
00:03:58
when your legs are already warmed up
00:04:00
from doing squats so this is a good way
00:04:03
to use our strength sessions to also
00:04:05
increase our mobility so personally for
00:04:07
me i've also enjoyed raising up on my
00:04:09
toes between each squat this allows me
00:04:12
to work my calves obviously
00:04:15
but it also allows the calves to release
00:04:18
more and let me get deeper into my squat
00:04:21
position at the bottom so seek a range
00:04:23
of motion that's as deep as possible for
00:04:26
you trying to get your thigh to touch
00:04:28
your calf is a good goal to shoot for
00:04:31
00:04:32
and if you're having trouble
00:04:34
getting this range of motion
00:04:36
elevate your heels elevating your heels
00:04:38
will allow you to get deeper and it also
00:04:41
shifts more weight into your toes which
00:04:44
puts more stress on the quads for me
00:04:47
personally even though i don't need much
00:04:49
assistance in my range of motion i still
00:04:52
do about half of my sets with my heels
00:04:55
00:04:56
raised in order to
00:04:58
drive more quad pump so after 30 days
00:05:01
assess how you feel by now you should
00:05:04
have
00:05:05
doubled the amount of squats you're
00:05:07
doing per week and test if your range of
00:05:09
motion has increased feel free to repeat
00:05:13
this 30-day cycle with using a higher
00:05:16
rep count so if you did it with 20
00:05:18
you can do it again with 25 or even 30.
00:05:21
so for me personally i've been traveling
00:05:23
for the last two months and this has
00:05:25
been really really efficient for me with
00:05:28
no equipment and having a little bit
00:05:30
less time for training have any of you
00:05:32
guys experimented with using the
00:05:35
