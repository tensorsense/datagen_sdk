staying healthy at home is easy here's
00:00:03
the right way to do squats
00:00:04
with tips from our physios we need to
00:00:07
keep our lower limb muscles
00:00:09
especially the glutes quadriceps and
00:00:12
hamstrings
00:00:13
strong we also need to make sure our hip
00:00:16
and knee joints are healthy when
00:00:19
performing a squat position
00:00:20
keep your feet slightly wider than your
00:00:22
shoulder width
00:00:24
begin the squat by pushing your bottom
00:00:26
back and towards the ground
00:00:28
then start lowering yourself by bending
00:00:30
your knees and hips
00:00:32
go as low as you feel comfortable
00:00:35
having your arms out in front can help
00:00:37
you counterbalance
00:00:40
the easiest way to squat is by moving
00:00:42
from a sitting position
00:00:43
to a standing position from a chair if
00:00:46
you like to push yourself
00:00:48
add some weights like a heavy bag or a
00:00:50
water bottle
00:00:51
00:00:52
you can even add a hold or pause to your
00:00:54
squat
00:00:55
00:00:56
while doing the squat make sure your
00:00:57
00:00:58
knees don't go in front of your feet
00:01:00
this is especially important if you have
00:01:02
any issues with your knees
00:01:04
placing something under your heels can
00:01:06
make it more comfortable if you've got
00:01:08
any ankle problems
00:01:09
this is a great exercise to strengthen
00:01:11
your back
00:01:12
make sure you have a neutral spine
00:01:15
during this exercise
00:01:16
and don't go too low if you aren't
00:01:18
comfortable
00:01:20
stay healthy and take care
