00:00:01
oh hi i'm bob schrupp physical therapist
00:00:03
and i'm brad heineck physical therapist
00:00:05
together we are the most famous physical
00:00:06
therapist on the internet in our opinion
00:00:08
of course bob what's got in your hands
00:00:09
bob brad this is a simulated weight a
00:00:11
barbell
00:00:12
sure and these are the weights on the
00:00:14
end of it so
00:00:15
we're going to go over the three most
00:00:17
important rules
00:00:19
to doing a safe squat right safe squat i
00:00:22
think
squatting with a barbell with a barbell
00:00:24
is an excellent way for strengthening
00:00:26
for
00:00:27
not total body but for a great not a
00:00:29
great deal of the muscles yeah the big
00:00:31
muscles in the hips and the legs
00:00:33
and if you do it properly it helps
00:00:34
strengthen the back as well all these
00:00:36
rolls
00:00:37
so let's get the weight over okay and
00:00:40
you're going to have a squat rack and
00:00:41
everything here usually don't do it open
00:00:43
like
on the shoulders by the way not on the
00:00:44
neck here right
00:00:46
right yeah back here at the shoulder so
00:00:48
you got a little meat there a lot of
00:00:49
times there'll be a little cushion on
00:00:50
that bar we're not going to get into
00:00:52
that
00:00:53
okay now the first thing we're going to
00:00:54
do is back
00:00:56
what's going on with the back when the
00:00:57
arch of the left arch the back of the
00:00:59
little angle there
00:01:00
so if i put a straight line here like
00:01:02
this we're going to use this for
00:01:03
to make sure we're straight his head's
00:01:05
touching we're here
00:01:06
and the butt's touching we got a little
00:01:08
arch right in here
00:01:09
00:01:10
that's a healthy arch okay maintain that
00:01:12
posture throughout the whole lift
00:01:14
okay now we're going to look down at the
00:01:16
legs
00:01:17
go ahead bob sweat and if you put a line
00:01:21
straight up from the toes the knee
00:01:22
should not go
00:01:23
past that line that would be improper
00:01:26
too much pressure on the knees you're
00:01:28
gonna
00:01:29
damage your knees with doing that and
00:01:31
this takes a practice to do this right
00:01:32
you're gonna practice it
00:01:33
with a dummy barbell like this or an
00:01:35
empty barbell
00:01:37
and what you want to do too is is keep
00:01:39
your head
00:01:40
up straight up don't be going like this
00:01:42
right
00:01:43
there goes the back up yep so you're
00:01:45
keeping the back
00:01:46
up and down and down straight okay so
00:01:49
again straight back the knee should not
00:01:51
00:01:52
go past this plumb line and then
00:01:54
i see this a lot in the weight room and
00:01:57
i've seen it
00:01:58
in competition as well you have to go
00:02:00
down so far
00:02:01
but you don't want to go if you put a
00:02:04
line with the
00:02:05
femur this should go parallel but not
00:02:08
dip
down now bob is breaking all kinds of
00:02:10
levels here i'm breaking the forward
00:02:12
rule i'm leaning too far
00:02:13
forward everything is terrible right i
00:02:15
see you guys go way down they have more
00:02:17
flexibility than me but they're way down
00:02:19
like this
right the younger people can keep that
00:02:21
knee where it belongs
00:02:23
and then they end up squatting too deep
00:02:25
and there's no reason to go back
00:02:27
past level right if you're not competing
00:02:29
right
00:02:30
there's just no reason at all it's just
00:02:32
put a lot of stress on the back your
00:02:33
background's out there's no way that you
00:02:35
can stop your back
00:02:36
from not rounding out which is a problem
00:02:38
and i've seen uh as a matter of fact my
00:02:40
nephew was a big power lifter in high
00:02:42
school
he's 25 now and he's got back problems
00:02:45
and i'm sure it's from absolutely yeah
00:02:49
terrible body mechanics
00:02:50
um and they all did i mean most of them
00:02:53
um because
00:02:54
that it takes a lot of practice and uh
00:02:56
people aren't patient enough i guess
00:02:58
right like brad said you want to start
00:02:59
off with uh no weight or
00:03:01
very little weight so once again bob
00:03:05
if you want to be strong like bull i
00:03:07
think if you lift the lift properly and
