00:00:02
start with your feet slightly wider than
00:00:04
shoulder width apart
00:00:06

00:00:09

00:00:11
shoulder and vice versa pointing your
00:00:13
elbows straight ahead now from here
00:00:15
shift your weight to the ball of your
00:00:17
feet
00:00:18
and bend your knees
00:00:21
get as close to 90 degrees as you can
00:00:23
looking straight ahead and from here
00:00:25
push back up to the starting position
