00:00:10
okay welcome everyone to a new episode
00:00:12
of myth-busting
00:00:14
this week we're gonna be looking at the
00:00:15
idea that the knees shouldn't go past
00:00:17
the toes in the squat because it's
00:00:19
improper technique or more likely to
00:00:21
cause injury to the knees um so this
00:00:23
idea is pretty common in personal
00:00:25
training circles and I think it's one of
00:00:27
those bits of dogma that have just
00:00:29
gotten handed down over time without any
00:00:32
real thoughtful consideration of the
00:00:35
scientific literature I think the idea
00:00:36
probably originates from a 1972 study
00:00:39
which found that of the 12 study
00:00:41
subjects the subject that the greatest
00:00:43
forward knee movement also had the
00:00:45
greatest sheer force on the tibia
00:00:47
femoral joint so the joint that connects
00:00:49
the tibia the big shin bone to the femur
00:00:52
the big bone of the upper leg and sheer
00:00:54
force in this context just refers to a
00:00:56
pair of opposing forces as to say one
00:00:59
force that pushes the tibia forward and
00:01:01
another that pulls the femur back and if
00:01:03
these shearing forces get too high it
00:01:05
can result in knee pain and if taken to
00:01:08
the extreme ACL tears or other injuries
00:01:10
now much more recent literature has
00:01:12
taken a hard line against this dataset
00:01:14
for not controlling for squat depth and
00:01:16
not including a description of the squat
00:01:19
technique they use now leading to the
00:01:20
speculation that perhaps the shearing
00:01:22
forces were due to a very upright
00:01:24
posture um so with that preliminary
00:01:25
paper aside I'd like to say that first
00:01:28
and probably most common sensical II I
00:01:31
think the knees can clearly go past the
00:01:33
toes without causing issues for example
00:01:35
when you go down the stairs your knees
00:01:37
clearly go past your toes but this
00:01:39
hardly ever causes pain in healthy knees
00:01:42
also in sports like Olympic
00:01:44
weightlifting you'll very often see very
00:01:46
extreme angles of knee flexion with the
00:01:48
knees way out past the toes and while
00:01:51
injuries certainly do occur many of
00:01:53
these athletes don't experience any knee
00:01:55
issues but anecdotes aside the main
00:01:58
point that I'd raise here is that we
00:01:59
shouldn't base technique guidelines for
00:02:01
multi-joint movements I like the squat
00:02:03
by only considering the forces involved
00:02:06
at one joint in this case the knee joint
00:02:08
while ignoring the forces at other
00:02:11
joints involved in the exercise so say
00:02:13
like the hip or the low back um so in
00:02:15
2003 fryin colleagues compared knee
00:02:18
and hip torques in two variations of the
00:02:20
squat one where their knees were
00:02:22
permitted to travel past their toes and
00:02:24
the other where a wooden board prevented
00:02:26
the knees from moving past the toes the
00:02:28
squat was taken to parallel in both
00:02:30
cases and as expected knee torque was
00:02:32
greater when the knees traveled further
00:02:34
forward so in the unrestricted squat
00:02:36
um so there was a difference of 150
00:02:39
Newton meters in the normal squat versus
00:02:41
117 Newton meters in the restricted
00:02:43
squat but just look at the difference in
00:02:45
hip torque between these two techniques
00:02:47
there's only 28 and the normal squat
00:02:49
that 302 and the restricted squat that's
00:02:52
more than a 10 fold difference in hip
00:02:54
torque just by keeping the knees back
00:02:56
and this finding led the authors to
00:02:57
suggest that it is appropriate to permit
00:02:59
forward displacement of the knees past
00:03:02
the toes during this exercise to permit
00:03:04
proper positioning of the torso
00:03:06
obviously this forward displacement must
00:03:08
not be excessive but instead should be
00:03:10
carefully regulated so basically as you
00:03:12
can see in the image forcing the knees
00:03:14
to stay back will force lifters to lean
00:03:16
further forward increasing strain on the
00:03:18
hips and low back so to me this seems
00:03:20
like a bit of an unreasonable trade-off
00:03:22
a slight reduction in knee to work for a
00:03:24
massive increase in the potential for
00:03:27
shear forces at the lower back and this
00:03:29
idea is supported by data from lists and
00:03:31
colleagues suggesting that there's less
00:03:33
stress on the lower back during an
00:03:35
unrestricted squat than during a
00:03:36
restricted squat and practitioners
00:03:38
shouldn't be overly strict with athletes
00:03:40
or clients in coaching against anterior
00:03:43
knee displacement during performance of
00:03:45
the squat um so to make this a little
00:03:47
more actionable I think a good squat
00:03:49
meets a few main criteria and the knees
00:03:52
not going past the toes isn't one of
00:03:54
them first the heels must stay firmly
00:03:56
planted on the ground a moderate forward
00:03:58
knee travel is okay as long as you
00:04:02
aren't shifting your weight up onto your
00:04:03
toes
00:04:04
second the weight on the bar must stay
00:04:06
centered over the middle of the foot
00:04:08
this means that when you're looking at
00:04:09
the squat from side on the bar should
00:04:11
travel up and down in a perfectly
00:04:13
straight line and thirdly your knees
00:04:15
should generally point in the same
00:04:17
direction as your toes they shouldn't
00:04:19
cave in or be forced out excessively
00:04:21
except for in some advanced cases so
00:04:24
these are the main principles and I
00:04:26
would say the rest of the technique
00:04:27
details as ice
00:04:28
it will depend on your body's
00:04:30
proportions which is determined mainly
00:04:32
by your skeleton that you really can't
00:04:35
do anything about so how much forward
00:04:37
lean you'll have in the squat will rely
00:04:39
largely on your femur length especially
00:04:41
relative to your tibia and you'll
00:04:43
necessarily have more forward lean if
00:04:45
you have longer femurs your skeleton can
00:04:48
also strongly affect how deep you can go
00:04:50
and how deep you should go on the squat
00:04:52
and I think rather than endorsing
00:04:54
across-the-board ask to grass squat the
00:04:57
approach I recommend is to go as deep as
00:04:59
you comfortably can but the goal of
00:05:01
trying to reach I guess at least
00:05:03
parallel as this sort of minimum
00:05:05
standard for strength and size goals but
00:05:08
I'll digress there and I'll wrap it up
00:05:09
here by saying that the idea that your
00:05:11
knees shouldn't go past your toes in the
00:05:13
squat is busted I will note that this
00:05:16
doesn't apply to all exercises so in the
00:05:19
lunge for example I think you really
00:05:21
should try to limit that forward knee
00:05:23
travel because you can maintain a much
00:05:25
more easily upright position in that
00:05:27
00:05:28
exercise meaning that trade-off between
00:05:29
the knees and the hips isn't quite there
00:05:32
in the same way and of course my
00:05:33
recommendations here are meant to apply
00:05:35
to healthy active regularly exercising
00:05:38
folks so if you are already experiencing
00:05:41
knee pain and I think you'll want to get
00:05:43
the counsel of an actual expert for that
00:05:46
but for now I think I want to wrap that
00:05:47
one up here many of you guys will know
00:05:49
that I've made it a goal of mine to
00:05:51
really increase my own strength on the
00:05:53
squat and the other to power lifts as a
00:05:55
part of my new plan for the rest of this
00:05:58
year and I am a fan of using proper
00:06:00
training equipment so if you guys are
00:06:02
looking to get a new belt or maybe some
00:06:05
knee sleeves to not only keep everything
00:06:07
tight and safe but also just help you
00:06:10
lift more weight you can check out the
00:06:12
stuff that my sponsor Rhys has to offer
00:06:15
I'll have a link down there in the
00:06:16
description to some of their stuff if
00:06:17
you'd like to check it out and the
00:06:19
equipment that I'm using in my own
00:06:21
training and this is a way that you can
00:06:23
support me and take your training to the
00:06:25
next level without any real downside or
00:06:28
drawback other than price so I'll leave
00:06:31
that up to you guys to decide so anyway
00:06:34
thank you guys so much for watching
