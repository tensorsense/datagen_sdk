how to do
00:00:25
squats squats help strengthen your
00:00:28
glutes your quadriceps and your
00:00:30
hamstrings for a basic squat start with
00:00:32
your legs just about shoulder width
00:00:34
apart lift your arms up in front of you
00:00:37
for balance make sure your back is
00:00:40
absolutely straight and you do not arch
00:00:42
your back inwards or outwards your back
00:00:45
and neck must be in one line now push
00:00:49
your hips back as though you are sitting
00:00:51
on an imaginary
00:00:53
chair your hips and thighs must be
00:00:56
parallel to the floor maintaining your
00:00:58
form come up to the neutral
00:01:01
position make sure that when you sit
00:01:03
down in a squat position your knees do
00:01:05
not collapse while you're doing a squat
00:01:08
inhale when you go down and exhale when
00:01:10
00:01:11
you come
00:01:16
up now let's see the squat position from
00:01:19
the
00:01:21
side back is straight knees are in line
00:01:24
with the toes thighs and hips are
00:01:27
parallel to the floor now this is the
00:01:30
ideal position your body should be in
00:01:32
when you
00:01:33
squat while coming up do not lock your
00:01:36
knees this puts unnecessary pressure on
00:01:39
the joint to begin with you can start
00:01:41
00:01:42
with three sets with at least 10 reps in
00:01:44
the first set 12 reps in the second set
00:01:46
and 15 reps in the third set you can
00:01:49
always increase the number of sets or
00:01:52
the number of
00:01:53
[Music]
00:01:56
reps as you graduate through the
00:01:58
exercise with proper form
00:02:00
you will eventually build up strength
00:02:02
and
00:02:06
endurance once your stamina increases
00:02:09
you can also hold the squat position for
00:02:11
a few seconds and do
00:02:16
