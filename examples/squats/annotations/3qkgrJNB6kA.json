For low bar squats: The hips are pushed back, and the head is kept neutral, allowing for better balance and increased muscle engagement.", "wrong": "For high bar squats: The ankle angle is too severe, leading to potential instability. For low bar squats: The lifter does not go deep enough, reducing the effectiveness of the squat.", "correction": "For high bar squats: Work on ankle mobility exercises to improve stability. For low bar squats: Focus on maintaining depth to ensure full engagement of muscles."}}}]
